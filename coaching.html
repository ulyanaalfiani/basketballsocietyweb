					Man-to-Man Defense - Complete Coaching Guide The traditional man-to-man defense is by far
					the most common defense in the game of basketball today. This is especially true as players
					progress to a higher level of competition. In fact, due to the great outside shooting of professional players, every NBA team almost exclusively plays man-to-man defense. The man-to-man defense involves all 5 defensive players on the court being allocated one opposition player who they're accountable for defending whenever they're on defense. Of course, there will be times when players switch opponents or help each other on defense, but for the most part, each player is responsible for one player from the opposition. Learning to be a great man-to-man defender is perhaps the most important skill for a player to learn during their years of youth basketball. No matter what defense a player goes on to play at the next level or on another team, the skills they learn playing man-to-man defense will transfer. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for players that solely learn zone defense. If you're coaching youth basketball, taking the time to teach your team man-to-man defense will go a long way to preparing them for the next level.
